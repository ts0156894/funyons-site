       <p>"Crying on camera is so taxing.  It's like, legit emotional labor," our source tells The Funyon, who asks their name not be used in light of recent callouts. Artificial Intelligence is the most recent boom in technology and has been taking the world by storm.  Those crocodile tears have never looked more real, with Artificial Apology, a new service that uses generative AI technology to bring your sincerity to life.  Early reception on social media has been mixed, but the model shows promise to simplify the lives of content creators, CEOs, and politicians trying to keep up with these ever-changing times.</p>

       <h2 id="A2">Second Grade Teacher Outraged by Class Reaction to "Chocolate Ice Cream" Emoji</h2> 
       <p>Giggles and chaos overtook the classroom when the happy dessert lit up the screen last Wednesday. Second grade teacher Gully Bullguy lashed out on Facebook over the "inappropriate minds" of the next generation; students who allegedly mistook the softserve ice cream presented as some sort of "excrement." The rant has since gone viral, and perhaps not the way Bullguy had hoped.  As laugh reacts light up the notifications, we ask our readers: have you ever used the poop emoji in a different context? Let us know!</p>
